# Function - simply put; a code block of 
# instructions for computers to follow.

# Built- in Function - a code block of 
# instruction for a computer to follow
# that was already written for us.
# PRE-WRITTEN CODE INSTRUCTIONS

# Data casting functions 
# these are built in functions (pre-written instructions) 
# that change data types from one from into another

# str() - this datacasting function allows you to change
# any data type into a string

year = 1906
print("This event took place in"+ str(year)) 

# string concatenation - combining string data types 
# with one another. We use the plus sign (+) operator
# to combine strings together

print(3+3) # ADDING 2 interger 
print("7"+"4") # COMBINING 2 strings 
print("good" +"bye")
print("ten"+"4"+"7") # COMBINING 3 strings 

# int()- Any data type passed into the brackets will
# be converted into a interger(whole number) 

num1 = int(input("type in a number: "))
#input always returns a string
print(4 + int(num1))

# Float()- A function that will change any datatype
# passed into it, into a float/decimal number

num2 = input("type in a number: ")
# input always returns a string
print(9 + float(num2))
